# LLaMA 3B - Human vs Robot: DPO Finetuning Comparison

This project compares **LLaMA 3B Instruct** before and after **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**, highlighting the shift in response style from **empathetic and conversational** to **factual and formal**.

We explore how DPO improves alignment to factuality and preferences, but may reduce the model's "personality."

##  Setup

> All responses were generated using `LLaMA 3.2B Instruct`, with and without DPO, using the same set of prompts.

- **Model**: meta-llama/Llama-3-3b-instruct
- **DPO Method**: Hugging Face TRL `DPOTrainer`
- **Hardware**: RTX 3090, 29GB RAM
- **Decoding**: `max_new_tokens=100`, `temperature=0.7`

##  Common Prompts and Model Behavior

Below are real side-by-side responses comparing **Base LLaMA** and **DPO-aligned LLaMA** for creative, emotional, and reflective prompts.
